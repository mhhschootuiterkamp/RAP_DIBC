# RAP_DIBC


This repository contains the software belonging to the paper "Symmetric separable convex resource allocation problems with structured disjoint interval bound constraints", which is available at https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15459. The repository contains 
- a Python module Alg_disjoint.py for the algorithm developed in the paper to solve the resource allocation problem with disjoint interval bound constraints;
- a script Comparison_RAP_DIBC.py that can be run directly to reproduce the numerical experiments in the paper. Warning: high total running time.
